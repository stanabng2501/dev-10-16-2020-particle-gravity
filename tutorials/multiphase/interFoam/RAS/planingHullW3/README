Overview
========
+ W3 example case of hydrodynamics of a planing hull

Mesh
====
+ The example includes two different approaches for meshing the case
+ The first approach uses no cell refinement in the vertical direction
+ The second approach includes local cell refinement, producing a smaller mesh
+ Cell refinement can cause disturbances of the interface
+ Where refinement is present, PLIC-based schemes perform much better,
  producing far less interface disturbance than the standard interface
  compression scheme.
+ The first approach has the advantage of avoiding interface disturbances but
  for the potential cost of a larger mesh than with local refinement

Experimental results (ref. 1)
=============================
+ Velocity = 4.598 m/s
+ Trim angle = 3.485 deg
+ Drag = 50.691 N

Numerical results mesh 1
========================
Without local refinement
+ Velocity = 4.598 m/s
+ Trim angle = 2.794 deg
+ Drag = 48.616 N

Numerical results mesh 2
========================
With local refinement
+ Velocity = 4.598 m/s
+ Trim angle = 3.027 deg
+ Drag = 47.987 N
