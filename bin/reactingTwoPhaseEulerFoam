# Script
#     reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam
#
# Description
#     Script to inform the user that the reactingtTwoPhaseEulerFoam solver
#     has been replaced by the more general multiphaseEulerFoam solver.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

echo "The reactingtTwoPhaseEulerFoam solver has been replaced" \
     "by the more general multiphaseEulerFoam solver"
echo "which supports two-phase and multiphase systems containing" \
     "fluid and stationary phases,"
echo "compressible or incompressible," \
     "with heat and mass transfer, reactions, size distribution"
echo "and all the usual phase interaction and transfer models."
echo
echo "When running with two-phases the optional referencePhase entry" \
     "in phaseProperties can be used to specify"
echo "which phase fraction should not be solved, providing compatibility" \
     "with reactingtTwoPhaseEulerFoam."
